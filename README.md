Hi! My name is Luciano Scabora, i am 30 years old living in Brazil. My favorite hobbies are watching cartoons and playing video games.

I am willing to become a developer, been practising Front End developement since a couple months.

I uploaded my studies results here so feel free to take a look and use them if it's of interest! :).

Actually i'm studying HTML/CSS, Javascript and React. But i also know a little of NodeJS and SQL Server.

I have a GitHub pages of a page i created during my studies and to show some love to my favorite videogame:
